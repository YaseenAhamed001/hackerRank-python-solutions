## 📁 Directory Overview

### `problems/`
Contains HackerRank problems grouped by domain and language.

- `algorithms/` – Algorithmic problem solutions  
- `data_structures/` – Data structure–focused problems  
- `sql/` – SQL queries and database-related problems  
- `python/` – Python-specific challenges  
- `C++/` – C++ language problems  

Each problem directory include:
- `{Problem_Name}_solution.py` (or relevant language file)
- `README.md` explaining:
  - problem description
  - approach
  - complexity analysis
  - HackerRank problem URL

---

### `docs/`
General documentation related to:
- repository organization
- coding standards
- contribution guidelines (future)

---

### `scripts/`
Utility and helper scripts for local development.

- `run_solution.py` – Script to run problem solutions locally (optional automation tool)

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hackerRank-python-solutions.git
cd hackerRank-python-solutions
```

## 🛠 Repository Automation

This repository structure was generated using a custom Python script (create_repo_structure.py) that:
- Uses the os module
- Supports CLI-based directory selection
- Creates files and folders recursively
- Follows safe, idempotent operations
- This demonstrates practical scripting and automation skills.

## 💡 Design Principles Followed

- Clean and scalable directory structure
- Separation of concerns (problems vs scripts vs docs)
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Resume-friendly, industry-aligned organization

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add detailed README files per problem
- Include time & space complexity analysis
- Add unit tests for selected problems
- Extend automation scripts
